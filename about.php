    <h1 class="meanTitle">What Does a Digital Contract mean?</h1>
    <p>In the modern world, the role of remotely controlled services to improve human life is increasing, including the development of contract law, which introduced and established a new standard. A digital contract is a legally binding document that is created and signed online. The parties themselves, within the framework of free will, determine the standard provisions of the contract and make the decision independently. This agreement is a document with binding force, in case of violation of which a natural or legal person will be held liable under the norms of the Civil Code of Georgia. This, in turn ensures, that only one party is not represented in a dominant position and cannot  manipulate the other party.</p>

<h1 class="securityTitle">Digital Signature and Cyber Security</h1>
<p>Digital Signature is an innovative method of concluding contracts online, which, unlike Electronic Signature, has a higher degree of security. Various experiments have shown that electronic signatures in PDF files allow certain types of manipulations, known as:</p>
<ol class="firstOl">
        <li>ISA (Incremental Saving Attack)</li>
        <li>SWA (Signature Wrapping Attack)</li>
        <li>USF (Universal Signature Forgery)</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this makes it easy to enter into any contract on behalf of someone, without knowing anything about it, or a contract can be entered into, but it is doubtful that the person will control the performance of the obligation to be fulfilled which would substantially harm your legitimate interests.
Despite the development of digital technologies, it can be said that the risk of committing cybercrime is increasing, which is often difficult to detect.
Digital contracts is a newly created company which is operating on  in purpose of your security, which we are constantly working on and we are trying to establish a high standard of cybersecurity, for this reason, we offer various protection mechanisms:</p>

<ol class="secondOl">
        <li>Verify the authenticity of the user before concluding the contract through e-mail authorization to avoid illegal actions.</li>
        <li>The second protection measure lies in the text message code, sent to the user before concluding the contract, which is one-time and constantly changing, thus confirming the user's consent to the contract.</li>
